# Troubleshooting Scenario

The manifests in this directory represent a **broken production deployment**. Your team deployed these manifests and the application is not working. Users are reporting errors.

## Your Task

1. Review the manifests and identify **all the issues**
2. Document each issue you find in `docs/troubleshooting.md`
3. For each issue explain:
   - What is wrong
   - Why it causes a problem
   - How to fix it

## Context

- The application was working before this deployment
- The Docker images exist and are valid
- The Kubernetes cluster is healthy
- Redis is running and accessible at `redis:6379`

## Hints

There are **at least 8 issues** across these manifests. Some are obvious, some are subtle.

Good luck!
